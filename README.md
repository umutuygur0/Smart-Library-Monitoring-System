# Smart Library Monitoring System

This repository showcases the **Smart Library Monitoring System**, a computer vision-based project developed in collaboration with **TED University**. The project is officially approved by the university and is being implemented in our **campus library**.

## üéØ Project Overview

- A ceiling-mounted camera system captures still images every 20 seconds.
- Each frame is analyzed using **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** for real-time object detection.
- Individual desk areas are defined using polygonal regions.
- Occupancy is determined by combining object detection with **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)** image comparison.
- Each area (spot) is classified as:
  - ‚úÖ **EMPTY**
  - üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **OCCUPIED**
  - ‚è≥ **HOLD** (transitional state)

## üîß Current Status

We are currently in the **hardware setup and system testing phase**. Cameras are being installed and initial evaluations are being conducted within the TED University Library with full institutional support.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

This public repository is intended for **demonstration and presentation purposes**. It includes:

- üé• A **demo video** of the system in action.
- üìä **Presentation slides** explaining the system architecture and goals.
- üìù A summary of the **project objectives**, methods, and applications.

> **Note:**  
> The source code is hosted in a private repository during development.
